## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full-stack engineer. I focus on providing accessible HTML, CSS that is up to date, and clean JavaScript. As a full-stack developer, I can create client-facing apps and websites with cutting-edge back-end support. I usually use the MERN stack, but I'm flexible enough to utilize whatever tools are required.

I specialize in creating solid backends for your app or website that handle all of the heavy liftings. I enjoy creating systems that are both light and powerful, distributed yet coordinated, and beautiful yet functional. I'd like to continue producing individualized goods for people by combining my passion for learning with my software development talents.
